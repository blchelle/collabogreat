# CollaboGreat

CollaboGreat is team collaboration software designed and configurable for projects of any any scale.

## Live Site 🌎

CollaboGreat is officially release to the public at https://collabogreat.brockchelle.com and I'm still working on even more features!
Take a look at my [Project Board](https://github.com/blchelle/collabogreat/projects/2) to see what I'm currently working on.

## Key Features ⭐

🔨 A fully functional demo environment so that users aren't forced to create an account in order to try the product.

🔒 OAuth Authentication with Google, Facebook or Github so it will only take a couple of clicks to sign in.

👷 Projects: Here users can invite other users to collectively organize the workload of their projects through tasks.

🔳 Interactive Kanban Boards where users can drag and drop tasks to change their ordering, and status. 

🌓 Light Mode / Dark Mode Theme Switcher for whatever suits your eye.

📱 Responsive user interface (Try it out on your phone!).

🔥 Blazing fast search if you need to quickly find a project or task.
